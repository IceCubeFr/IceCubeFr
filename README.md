## Experience
I worked as a community developper for a year in MOD, a community server from the game NovaLife:Amboise. This is where I learned C# and created my most downloaded project, NearbyShare (around 400 downloads in march 2025, this is an important number compared to the community).  
I also worked from February 2024 to August 2024 as a member of NovaLife:Amboise's support, where I learned how to correctly help people to solve their problems.  
Finally, I worked on SAE, Situations of Training evaluated, during my BUT, and you can find all of them in this GitHub.
